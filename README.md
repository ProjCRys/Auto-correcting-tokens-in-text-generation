Certainly. I'll update the GitHub description with the provided title. Here's the revised version:

# Auto-correcting Tokens in Text Generation

An innovative text generation tool that combines the power of GPT-2 with a custom iterative algorithm to generate sentences matching a target text, automatically correcting tokens along the way.

## Features

- Utilizes the GPT-2 language model for coherent text generation
- Implements a unique token-by-token matching and auto-correction algorithm
- Provides a user-friendly GUI for input and real-time output visualization
- Supports multi-line input with preserved formatting
- Displays generation progress in real-time

## How it works

1. The user inputs a target text in the GUI.
2. The system tokenizes the input and initializes generation with the first token.
3. In each iteration:
   - It generates the next token using GPT-2 if needed.
   - It randomly updates tokens to match the target, simulating auto-correction.
   - It may insert correct tokens from the target sequence.
   - It trims excess tokens if necessary.
4. The process continues until the generated text matches the target or reaches the maximum number of attempts.

## Setup

1. Run `setup.bat` to create a virtual environment and install dependencies.
2. Execute `run.bat` to start the application.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- Transformers library
- tkinter (usually comes pre-installed with Python)

## Note

This project demonstrates an interesting approach to guided text generation with auto-correction, combining the strengths of large language models with custom algorithms for specific text matching tasks. It showcases how token-level corrections can be applied in real-time during the generation process.
